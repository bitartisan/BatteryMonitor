# BatteryMonitor
Python 3 laptop battery monitor; issues audio and visual warnings when battery is on a low level

While learning a bit of Python, decided to write a very simple application for watching over the levels of my Linux Mint laptop battery. 

It has been tested only with https://linuxmint.com/ (which is based on Ubuntu / Debian).

Please feel free to use, prase or criticise as you see fit ;)
